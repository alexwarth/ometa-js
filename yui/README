YUI Library Release Notes

*** version 2.5.1 ***

This update contains the following:

- additions to the Yahoo, Uploader, Editor, and DataSource components to improve YUI support for Adobe AIR
- Douglas Crockford's fix for a security vulnerability where the JSON parser could be tricked into processing
an unquoted string as quoted which could allow unsafe scripts to be evaled
- a new aggregate file Ñ yuiloader-dom-event.js that is the ideal baseline rollup to use to be able to 
lazy-load any part of YUI on-demand
- over 60 bug fixes

Please see the README file for each component in the build directory for specific updates since
version 2.5.0.

*** version 2.5.0 ***

This release introduces six new components into YUI:

   * Cookie Utility

*** version 2.4.1 ***

This update contains one change.  We have reverted the change to the way the Event Utility cleans up 
events in its page unload handler that was introduced in 2.4.0. The change resulted in some events
not being properly unloaded, which in turn resulted in IE-specific memory leaks in some YUI components
including the Menu Control and controls in the Container Family.

Widget which is released as an experimental component.  Please see the YUI FAQ

*** version 0.10.0 ***

In this release, the directory structure has been modified to provide more
component organization.  This is the new format:

yui/
  |
  -- build/
  | |
  | -- dom/
  | |
  | | -- assets/
  | |
  | | -- dom.js
  | |
  -- docs/
  | |
  | -- dom/
  | |
  -- examples/
  | |
  | -- dom/
  | |
  | | -- img/

Notice there are three immediate directories under the
root YUI.  They are:

*build/*
This directory contains the source files for each YUI component, and each
component is presented as a sub-directory under build/.  Notice that there are
generally two source files: component.js and component-min.js.  The "component"
source is the raw, commented build and "component-min" is the minified version
of the same file with comments and whitespace removed.  With some components,
there is an assets sub-directory.  CSS and image dependencies for each
component are stored in its assets sub-directory.

Note: If a component makes use of images, the image source path in the
component's CSS file will point to Akamai.  The physical images are also
available in the assets/ directory for local availability.  Please modify the
CSS image references if you wish to use your own image assets.

*docs/*
This directory contains the jsdoc-generated API reference for every YUI
component.  Each component is presented as a sub-directory under docs/.

*examples/*
This directory contains functional examples for each component in the YUI
Library.  The examples are not part of the formal distribution; rather,
they provide demonstrations of each component in use.  Each example uses YUI
Library source files from the build/ directory, while all example-specific
dependencies are stored in sub-directories (e.g. examples/dom/img).
Some components, including the AutoComplete Control and Connection Manager,
make use of PHP to implement certain examples.

For example:
In yui/examples/dom, the dom.js source file and all YUI .js dependencies
are drawn from yui/build/ directories.  All other example-specific sources are
stored as sub-directories: yui/examples/dom/css and yui/examples/dom/img.

Each functional example is also available and functional on
developer.yahoo.com/yui/.  They reproduced here as part of the distribution
for your convenience.
